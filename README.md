# lapack-array2

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/ajz34/lapack-array2/graph/badge.svg?token=GtFGy8eRNb)](https://codecov.io/github/ajz34/lapack-array2)

Implementation of parameter-optional LAPACK wrapper by `ndarray::Array` (`Ix1` or `Ix2`) in rust.

**This is work-in-progress.**

- **Code Conventions**: For BLAS2 and BLAS3 wrapper, also see <https://github.com/ajz34/blas-array2>. Crate `blas-array2` is already applicable to real projects.
- **Implementation Priorities**: Since number of LAPACK functions is quite a lot, a few LAPACK functions will be implemented in different priorities.
